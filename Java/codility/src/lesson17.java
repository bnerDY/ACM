     For example, given the following array:

     A[0] = 1
     A[1] = -2
     A[2] = 0
     A[3] = 9
     A[4] = -1
     A[5] = -2
     one possible game could be as follows:

     the pebble is on square number 0, which is marked;
     we throw 3; the pebble moves from square number 0 to square number 3; we mark square number 3;
     we throw 5; the pebble does not move, since there is no square number 8 on the board;
     we throw 2; the pebble moves to square number 5; we mark this square and the game ends.
     The marked squares are 0, 3 and 5, so the result of the game is 1 + 9 + (âˆ’2) = 8.
     This is the maximal possible result that can be achieved on this board.
